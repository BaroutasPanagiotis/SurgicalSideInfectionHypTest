Title

Does Minimally Invasive Surgery Have a Lower Risk of Surgical Site Infections Compared With Open Spinal Surgery?

Description

This project investigates the risk of surgical site infections (SSI) in patients who have undergone either an open surgery (OS) or a minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Open Surgery (OS) involves larger incisions for a full view of the structures or organs involved, whereas Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) uses smaller incisions, leading to shorter recovery times and generally lower risks.

Data

The dataset used in this project consists of seven variables and 189 observations. The variables are as follows:

SSI: The presence or absence of Surgical Site Infection
Gender: Binary, with observations as Male or Female
Approach: The type of surgery each patient underwent, either Open or Minimally Invasive
PreOPCRP: Levels of C-Reactive Protein before the operation
PostOpCRP: Levels of C-Reactive Protein after the operation
PostOpAlbumin: Levels of Albumin before the operation
PreOpWCC: Levels of White Cells before the operation
Medical Terms
C-Reactive Protein (CRP): A protein made by the liver that increases with inflammation. Levels equal to or greater than 8 mg/L or 10 mg/L are considered high.
Albumin: A protein made by the liver that helps maintain osmotic pressure, transports substances, and neutralizes free radicals. Normal levels range from 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL.
White Blood Cells (WCC): Cells that are part of the body's immune system, helping to fight infection and other diseases.

Research Questions

Is the presence of SSI independent of the surgical approach?
Is the presence of SSI independent of gender?
Is there a significant difference in the rise in CRP (before and after surgery) between patients with and without SSI?
Is there a significant difference in preoperative albumin levels between patients with and without SSI?
Is there a significant difference in preoperative white cell counts between patients with and without SSI?
Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics were calculated for each variable, including frequencies for categorical variables and summary statistics for numerical variables.

Inferential Statistics

Several statistical tests were performed to answer the research questions:

Chi-squared test: Used to test the independence of categorical variables (SSI vs. Approach, SSI vs. Gender).
Shapiro-Wilk test: Used to test the normality of numerical variables.
Bartlett's test: Used to test the homogeneity of variances.
Mann-Whitney U test: Used for non-parametric comparisons of two independent groups.
T-test: Used for parametric comparisons of two independent groups.
Results

SSI and Surgical Approach: The Chi-squared test indicated a significant dependence between SSI and the type of surgery, suggesting that the surgical approach plays a crucial role in the development of SSI.
SSI and Gender: The Chi-squared test showed no significant dependence between SSI and gender.
CRP Levels: Mann-Whitney U test indicated a significant difference in the rise in CRP levels between patients with and without SSI.
Preoperative Albumin Levels: Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant difference in preoperative albumin levels between patients with and without SSI.
Preoperative White Cell Counts: T-test indicated no significant difference in preoperative WCC between patients with and without SSI.
